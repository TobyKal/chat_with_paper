# Chat with Paper: LLM Development Semi-sucess 📚🤖

**Update**: This repo’s on pause ⏸. I’ve teamed up with Langchain for a new chapter. But this place? It’s a snapshot of my LLM journey. 📸

## About the Project 🛠️
Chat with Paper was my quest to build an LLM app that would empower users to create stronger LLMs. I chose the path less traveled by skipping Langchain, aiming for a deeper dive into LLM tech. 🏊‍♂️

## Lessons Along the Way 🎓
The project taught me about:
- Building LLM architectures 🏗️
- Crafting question-answering systems ❓
- Managing and optimizing code ⚙️
- Debugging with determination 🔍
- Learning independently and solving problems 💡
- Dabbling in vector databases 🗃️ (just a fingertip, not the whole hand!)
- Strengthening Python fundamentals 🐍

Perfectionism led to many “great” ideas being scrapped, but the core concept will be reborn in a new repo (link coming soon). 🌱

## Why Check Out This Repo? 🤔
It’s a testament to development and discovery. If you’re curious about LLM applications or my development process, take a look. 👀

## Looking Ahead 🔮
The foundational idea of this project will be re-envisioned in a future repository. It’s a blank slate now, but it promises potential. 🌟

## Wrapping Up 🎁
Chat with Paper didn’t reshape the LLM world, but it was a valuable experience. 🌟

👋 **Best**,

**Toby**
